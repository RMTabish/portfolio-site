    description: 'In my first role as a Lab Demonstrator, I worked with students retaking the Programming Fundamentals course, focusing on C++ and Linux. While teaching the same curriculum as the regular class, the challenge was to help these students overcome their conceptual gaps. I encouraged them to articulate their understanding of topics, identified misunderstandings, and provided tailored guidance to improve their knowledge. Along with theory, I facilitated hands-on practice with C++ programming and Linux OS fundamentals. This role enhanced my ability to adapt my teaching style to diverse learning needs, mentor students individually, and help them build stronger programming and problem-solving skills.'
